# Etch-a-Sketch

This is somewhere between a sketch pad and an etch-a-sketch. I actually had a fairly easy time with a lot of the DOM concepts I've used in this project.

I do feel like I have a fairly good grasp on DOM methods and manipulation and I definitely feel a lot more confident in using for each loops, for loops and manipulating elements inside an array.
